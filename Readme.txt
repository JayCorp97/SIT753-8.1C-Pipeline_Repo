Part 1: Task 1 - GitHub Integration
Task Instructions
1. Create a GitHub repository and configure it to be used with Jenkins.
2. Create a Jenkins job that will be responsible for running the pipeline. The job should be triggered automatically whenever a new commit is pushed to the GitHub repository. You are NOT required to configure a webhook; simply triggering the pipeline based on a time interval (e.g., using a scheduled poll for commits) will be sufficient for this part.
